The purpose of this repository is to test and learn about machine learning algorithms that are commonly used in solving optimization problems. I've recently been assigned a work project which involves using AI/ML to reduce inefficiencies in company processes and produce useful figures.
<br><br>
AI/ML is an area in which I definitely want to be involved with but currently lack real experience with. As such, this repository acts as documentation for my journey in learning about and testing different models, potentially for use within my work project.
